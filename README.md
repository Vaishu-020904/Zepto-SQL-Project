 # Zepto-SQL-Project
Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project

# Project Overview
This project is a SQL-based data analysis portfolio project built on a real-world–inspired Zepto e-commerce inventory dataset (sourced from Kaggle).
Following the tutorial “Complete SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project with Real Zepto Data” by Amlan Mohanty, I designed and executed SQL queries in PostgreSQL to clean, explore, and generate business-relevant insights commonly required in retail and e-commerce analytics.

# Objectives

> import and clean the dataset (handle nulls, remove zeros, convert paise → ₹).
> Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL.
> Answer nine business-focused questions using analytical SQL queries.
> Summarize findings into insights that help optimize inventory and pricing strategies.

# Key Insights & Queries
The project answers nine real-world inventory questions:

1. Top Discounts → Which product SKUs have the highest discount percentage?
2. High-MRP Stockouts → What high-MRP products (MRP > ₹500) are out of stock?
3. Revenue by Category → Estimated revenue per category (quantity × price).
4. Discount Patterns → Which categories have the highest average discounts?
5. Best Value → Which SKUs offer the best price per gram value?
6. Weight Segmentation → How many products fall into Low / Medium / Bulk weight groups?
7. Category Weight → What is the total inventory weight per category?
8. Missed Opportunities → Which out-of-stock products have high MRP?
9. Overstock Risk → Which SKUs have zero quantity sold but large stock?

# Tools & Technologies
PostgreSQL (SQL queries, ETL, aggregations, window functions)
pgAdmin / psql CLI (query execution & analysis)
Kaggle dataset (Zepto inventory data)

# Outcomes
- Designed 8+ business-driven SQL queries aligned with retail KPIs.
- Identified best-value products, potential overstock risks, and pricing inefficiencies.
- Simulated an end-to-end analyst workflow from raw dataset → cleaned data → insights.
- Built a portfolio project demonstrating SQL for business problem-solving.
